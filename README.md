## Tech Stack

- **Ruby**: 3.x (check `.ruby-version` if present, or use latest stable)
- **Rails**: 8.1.1
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with multiple schemas (app, cache, queue, cable)
- **Asset Pipeline**: Propshaft (modern replacement for Sprockets)
- **JavaScript**: Importmap, Stimulus, Turbo (Hotwire stack)
- **Web Server**: Puma
- **Testing**: RSpec with FactoryBot, Shoulda Matchers, and Faker
- **Quality Tools**: RuboCop, Brakeman, bundler-audit
- **Deployment**: Kamal-ready with Docker support
- **API**: RESTful JSON API (versioned at `/api/v1`)

## Architecture

This project follows the **Majestic Monolith** approach:
- Single Rails application that scales through simplicity and convention
- Traditional Rails MVC for web interfaces
- RESTful JSON API support available at `/api/v1` (optional)
- Comprehensive test coverage for all layers

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Ruby 3.x (recommended: use `rbenv` or `rvm`)
- PostgreSQL (via Homebrew on macOS: `brew install postgresql@15`)
- Bundler (`gem install bundler`)

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd budget-buddy
```

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

The project includes an automated setup script:

```bash
bin/setup
```

This will:
- Install Ruby dependencies
- Create and set up the database
- Prepare all database schemas (main, cache, queue, cable)
- Remove old logs and temp files
- Start the development server

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Copy the example environment file and configure your local values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in any required values. For local development, the defaults should work.

**Important**: Never commit `.env` to git - it's already in `.gitignore`.

### 4. Database setup

Make sure PostgreSQL is running:

```bash
# On macOS with Homebrew
brew services start postgresql@15
### 4. Database setup

Create and set up the database:

```bash
bin/rails db:create
bin/rails db:migrate
bin/rails db:seed
```

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
bin/dev
```

Or if you prefer to run Puma directly:

```bash
bin/rails server
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Testing

This project uses **RSpec** for testing with FactoryBot, Shoulda Matchers, and Faker.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bin/rspec

# Run a specific test file
bin/rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb

# Run a specific test by line number
bin/rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb:42

# Run tests matching a pattern
bin/rspec spec/models/
bin/rspec spec/requests/api/

# Run tests with a specific tag
bin/rspec --tag focus
bin/rspec --tag ~slow  # Exclude slow tests

# Run only failed tests from previous run
bin/rspec --only-failures

# Run tests with detailed output
bin/rspec --format documentation

# Run tests and show 10 slowest examples
bin/rspec --profile 10
```

### Useful Options

```bash
# Run tests in random order (detect order dependencies)
bin/rspec --order random

# Run tests with a specific seed (for reproducibility)
bin/rspec --seed 12345

# Run tests and stop on first failure
bin/rspec --fail-fast

# Run tests with coverage report (if SimpleCov is configured)
COVERAGE=true bin/rspec
```

## Authentication

Budget Buddy includes built-in user authentication powered by Rails 8's authentication generator with enhanced security features.

### Features

- **User Registration**: Create new accounts with email and password
- **Secure Login**: Session-based authentication with secure cookies
- **Password Reset**: Self-service password recovery via email
- **Session Management**: Track user sessions with IP and user agent
- **Strong Password Requirements**: Enforced password complexity rules

### User Registration

Users can register by providing:
- Email address (must be valid and unique)
- Password (must meet security requirements)

### Signing In

Sign in with your email address and password at `/session/new`.

After successful authentication:
- A secure session cookie is created (httponly, same_site: lax)
- User sessions are tracked with IP address and user agent
- Rate limiting protects against brute force attacks (10 attempts per 3 minutes)

### Signing Out

Sign out at any time by clicking "Sign out" or visiting `DELETE /session`.

This will:
- Destroy the current session
- Clear the session cookie
- Redirect to the sign-in page

### Password Reset

If you forget your password:

1. Visit `/passwords/new`
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your email for password reset instructions
4. Click the link in the email (valid for 24 hours)
5. Enter and confirm your new password
6. All existing sessions will be destroyed for security

**Security note**: The system shows the same success message whether the email exists or not, preventing email enumeration attacks.

### Password Requirements

Passwords must meet these requirements:
- **Minimum length**: 8 characters
- **Complexity**: Must include:
  - At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
  - At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
  - At least one digit (0-9)

Example valid passwords:
- `Password123`
- `MySecure1Pass`
- `Budget2024!`

### Authentication in Controllers

Controllers require authentication by default. To allow unauthenticated access:

```ruby
class PublicController < ApplicationController
  allow_unauthenticated_access
  
  def index
    # This action does not require authentication
  end
end
```

To require authentication for specific actions only:

```ruby
class MixedController < ApplicationController
  allow_unauthenticated_access only: [:index, :show]
  
  def index
    # Public action
  end
  
  def edit
    # Requires authentication
  end
end
```

### Authentication Helpers

Available in controllers and views:

```ruby
authenticated?           # Returns true if user is signed in
Current.user            # Returns the current user (or nil)
start_new_session_for(user)  # Create a new session for a user
terminate_session       # End the current session
```

### Security Features

- **CSRF Protection**: Enabled by default for all non-API requests
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects sign-in and password reset from abuse
- **Secure Sessions**: httponly cookies, same_site protection
- **Bcrypt Hashing**: Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- **Password Reset Tokens**: Signed tokens with 24-hour expiration
- **Session Tracking**: IP address and user agent logged for security audit

### Testing Authentication

```ruby
# In request specs
let(:user) { create(:user, password: 'Password123') }

# Sign in a user
post session_path, params: {
  email_address: user.email_address,
  password: 'Password123'
}

# Check if signed in
expect(cookies.signed[:session_id]).to be_present
```

For more authentication examples, see the specs in `spec/requests/sessions_spec.rb` and `spec/requests/passwords_spec.rb`.

## Development

### Development Guidelines

Follow the established patterns documented in the instruction files:
- [Rails Instructions](/.github/instructions/rails.instructions.md) - MVC patterns and conventions
- [API Instructions](/.github/instructions/api.instructions.md) - RESTful API development
- [Ruby Instructions](/.github/instructions/ruby.instructions.md) - SOLID principles and clean code

### Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for configuration and secrets.

**Setup**:
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your local values
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

**Usage in code**:
```ruby
# Access environment variables
ENV['DATABASE_PASSWORD']
ENV.fetch('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY')  # Raises error if not set

# Rails encrypted credentials (alternative)
Rails.application.credentials.stripe_secret_key
```

**Important**:
- ❌ Never commit `.env` to git (already in `.gitignore`)
- ❌ Never hardcode secrets in your code
- ✅ Use ENV vars for all sensitive data
- ✅ Update `.env.example` when adding new variables

**Available variables**: See `.env.example` for a complete list

**Sentry Error Tracking**:
To enable error tracking, sign up at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) (free tier), create a project, and add the DSN to your `.env`:
```bash
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-key@sentry.io/your-project-id
```

### Console

```bash
bin/rails console
```

### Git Workflow

**Branches**: `<type>/<ticket-id>-<description>` (e.g., `feat/123-add-budget-api`, `fix/456-validation-error`)

**Commits**: Follow [Conventional Commits](/.github/git-commit-instructions.md) specification

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`

### Code Quality

Run all quality checks:

```bash
bin/ci  # Runs tests with coverage, RuboCop, Brakeman, and bundler-audit
```

Individual checks:

```bash
# Tests
bundle exec rspec                    # Tests only
COVERAGE=true bundle exec rspec      # Tests with coverage report

# Code style
bundle exec rubocop                  # Check style
bundle exec rubocop -a               # Auto-fix violations

# Security
bundle exec brakeman -q              # Security analysis
bundle exec bundler-audit check      # Dependency vulnerabilities
```

**Test Coverage**: Minimum 85% total coverage, 75% per file. View detailed reports at `coverage/index.html` after running tests with `COVERAGE=true`.

For comprehensive coverage guidelines, see [Test Coverage Instructions](/.github/instructions/test-coverage.instructions.md).

## API Development

This project includes **RESTful JSON API support** alongside traditional Rails views.

### Quick Start

APIs are versioned at `/api/v1/`. A health check endpoint is available to verify the API is running:

```bash
# Start the server
bin/rails server

# Test the health check endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-07T12:00:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "development",
  "checks": {
    "database": true,
    "cache": true
  }
}
```

### Creating New API Endpoints

> **📘 For complete API patterns and templates**, see [API Instructions](/.github/instructions/api.instructions.md)

The API Instructions file contains everything needed to build RESTful APIs:
- Controller templates (Base + Resource with all CRUD actions)
- Routing patterns (standard + custom routes)
- HTTP status codes and response formats
- Authentication (JWT)
- Pagination, filtering, sorting
- Serializers
- Error handling
- Testing patterns

**Reference Files:**
- Health Check Controller: `app/controllers/api/v1/health_controller.rb`
- Health Check Specs: `spec/requests/api/v1/health_spec.rb`
- Base Controller: `app/controllers/api/v1/base_controller.rb`

## Security

This project implements comprehensive security measures to protect against vulnerabilities.

### Automated Security Scanning

**Tools in use:**
- **Brakeman** - Static code analysis for Rails security vulnerabilities
- **bundler-audit** - Checks gems for known CVEs
- **Dependabot** - Automated dependency updates every Monday

## Error Tracking

This project uses **Sentry** for automatic error capture and monitoring.

### Features

- 🐛 Automatic exception capture
- 📊 Error grouping and trends
- 🔔 Real-time alerts
- 📍 Stack traces with context
- 👤 User impact tracking
- 📈 Performance monitoring

### Setup

1. **Sign up** at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) (free tier: 5,000 events/month)
2. **Create a project** (select Ruby/Rails)
3. **Get your DSN** from project settings
4. **Add to .env**:
   ```bash
   SENTRY_DSN=https://your-key@sentry.io/your-project-id
   ```

### Configuration

**Enabled environments**: Development, production, and staging (test disabled by default)

**To disable in development** (if you prefer):
```ruby
# config/initializers/sentry.rb
config.enabled_environments = %w[production staging]
```

### Testing

Once you've added your `SENTRY_DSN` to `.env`:

```bash
# Test with rake task
bin/rails sentry:test

# Or in Rails console
bin/rails console
> Sentry.capture_message("Test error from console")
> raise "Test error - check Sentry dashboard"
```

Check your Sentry dashboard to see the captured events.

### What Gets Captured

- All uncaught exceptions
- Stack traces with file/line numbers
- Request data (URL, method, params)
- User context (when authenticated)
- Server environment
- Breadcrumbs (events leading to error)

### Sensitive Data

Automatically filtered:
- Passwords
- Tokens
- Authorization headers
- Any field named `secret`

Configuration: `config/initializers/sentry.rb`

## CI/CD

### GitHub Actions

The project includes a comprehensive CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that runs automatically on:
- Pull requests
- Pushes to the `main` branch

The pipeline includes:

1. **Tests**: Runs RSpec test suite with PostgreSQL
2. **Security Scans**:
   - Brakeman (static security analysis)
   - bundler-audit (gem vulnerability checking)
   - importmap audit (JavaScript dependency scanning)
3. **Linting**: RuboCop style enforcement

### Local CI
