# Brakeman Security Scanner Configuration
# https://brakemanscanner.org/docs/options/

# Ignore warnings with specific fingerprints
# Add fingerprints from brakeman output when you need to ignore false positives
# Always document WHY you're ignoring a warning
ignored_warnings: []

# Example of ignoring a specific warning (DO NOT USE without justification):
# - warning_type: "SQL Injection"
#   fingerprint: "abc123def456..."
#   note: "False positive - input is validated by X before reaching this code"

# Check all files, including those in vendor (if needed)
skip_files: []

# Exclude specific paths from scanning
exclude_paths:
  - node_modules/**/*
  - tmp/**/*
  - log/**/*
  - public/**/*
  - vendor/bundle/**/*

# Minimum confidence level to report (High, Medium, Weak)
# High = fewer false positives, might miss some issues
# Weak = more thorough, more false positives
min_confidence: 2  # Medium confidence

# Output format (text, json, html, csv, tabs, markdown)
output_format: text

# Return non-zero exit code if warnings found
# This makes CI fail when vulnerabilities are detected
exit_on_warn: true

# Return non-zero exit code if errors occurred during scan
exit_on_error: true

# Show full stack traces for internal errors (debugging)
debug: false

# Check for security updates to Brakeman
ensure_latest: true

# Additional checks (experimental features)
interprocedural: false
